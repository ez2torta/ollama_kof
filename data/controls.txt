D - Strong Kick

CD - Blowback Attack

P - With either Light Punch or Strong Punch

K - With either Light Kick or Strong Kick

AB - Evasive Roll, neutral or forward Ab while make the character roll forward, pressing it in the backward direction will make the character roll backward

GCAB - Guard Cancel Roll, press AB when guarding an attack, can also be done while using a normal, costs one meter 

GCCD - Guard Cancel Blowback Attack, press CD when guarding an attack, costs one meter. Often referred as CD Counter

cl.C - Standing close hit strong punch. Since most far hits are non-cancelable, standing attacks such as cl.C are always the close version

Far D - Standing far D

cr.B - Crouching or down B


== Input Priority ==

This is the way you call what happens when multiple buttons are pushed together.
This knowledge is interresting to know on its own, but it's mostly used for lab grinders to find "Option Select"s

In KOFXV, the priority works mostly in a standard way :

'''MaxMode/QuickMode > Roll  > Blowback > D > C > Taunt > B > A'''

Unless you are crouch, in that case, 2C > 2D

Which means :

- if you jump and press CD, you'll get j.CD, 

- if you jump and press AC, you'll get j.C

- if you crouch and press CD, you'll get 2C

- if you have no bar and press ABCD, you'll get a roll

- if you crouch and have no bar and press ABCD, you'll get 2C

etc.

                  down (d)

j. - Jump/jumping - Press and hold up-back/up/up-forward

Hyperjump - Press down-back/down/down-forward, then quickly press and hold up-back/up/up-forward

Hop - Tap up-back/up/up-forward

Hyperhop - Tap down-back/down/down-forward, then quickly tap up-back/up-forward

cl. – Close – Close standing attack (e.g. cl.C)

cr. – Crouch – Crouching attack (e.g. cr.B)

st. – Stand – Standing attack (e.g. st.B)

bb. – Backdash – Tap back twice quickly

ff. - Dash - Tap forward twice quickly

> - Follow-up - qcf+D > K means inputting K during qcf+D triggers a follow-up move.

== Hit detection notes ==

Although other sources may have different definitions, hit detection for this wiki is defined by the following:

''Overhead'' - An attack that must be blocked high.

''Mid'' - An attack that can be blocked either high or low.

''Low'' - An attack that must be blocked low.

== Advanced and Climax Cancel Buffer ==

The buffer window for Advanced and Climax Cancels is extremely generous and can be used to make some cancels much easier to perform, especially for supers with a big wind up before the final blow. As long as you perform the motions for the MAX Super or Climax Super and hold down the buttons for the super before the last hit, the Advanced or Climax Cancel will execute on the first possible frame.

For example, take Vanessa's Crazy Puncher super where she does 3 punches before bobbing and weaving and finishing performing an uppercut. Once she starts her weaving motion, you can input [[image:qcb.gif]] [[image:hcf.gif]] and hold down either AC for MAX Champion Puncher or CD for Infinity Puncher '''while not letting go of the buttons'''. Once she finishes her uppercut, the Advanced or Climax Cancel will launch immediately.
